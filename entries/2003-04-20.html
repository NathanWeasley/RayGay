<h>C++</h>
<p>Takket været <a href="http://david.tribble.com/text/javaconst.html">David R. Tribble</a> fattede jeg endeligt <tt>const</tt> modifieren i C++ som en read-only markør.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reference variable or constant declared as <tt>const</tt> refers to an object that cannot be modified. The reference variable itself can be modified (if it is not declared <tt>final</tt>), but the referrent object cannot be modified. Thus the <tt>const</tt> specifier applies to the value of the object referenced by the variable.</p>
<p>An object is modified whenever any of its accessible member variables are the subject of an assigment (or compound assignment) or increment/decrement operator. An object is also considered modified whenever a call is made to any of its member methods that are not declared <tt>const</tt></p>
